# 📝  Abstractive Text Summarizer with LSTM Attention Mechanism
🚀 An abstractive text summarization model using LSTM with an Attention Mechanism, trained on Amazon Fine Foods reviews.  

---

## 🔍 Overview  

Text summarization is a key NLP task that condenses long text into shorter versions while preserving meaning.  
This project leverages a **Sequence-to-Sequence (Seq2Seq) model** with an **Attention Mechanism** to generate high-quality summaries for Amazon reviews.  

### ✨ Features  

✅ Encoder-Decoder model using LSTM  
✅ Attention Mechanism for improved performance  
✅ Amazon Fine Foods Reviews dataset

## ⚙️ Model Architecture  

The model follows a **Seq2Seq architecture with Attention**:  

1️⃣ **Encoder:** Bi-directional LSTM to process input text  
2️⃣ **Attention:** Helps focus on relevant words while summarizing  
3️⃣ **Decoder:** LSTM generates summaries word-by-word  
4️⃣ **Softmax Layer:** Outputs probability distribution over vocabulary
